# My Programming Practice Space

Welcome to my programming practice repo!
This repo is contains some of my programming practices over these years, including some of my notes on programming languages, data structures, algorithms, frameworks (maybe comming later), tools, some starter code.

## Building with Cmake

Originally this repo only contains some C++ stuff, so you can use the CMakeList.txt in the root directory to build some of the source modules, but not all. They are listed below.

- sorting
- data_structure
- smart_pointer
- graph

## Other Modules

Other modules or directories are not included in the CMake build file. They are:

- cpp - some notes from my C++ programming experience
- concurrency-app - C++ with concurrency practice
- docker - sample starter docker files used to build from images
- miscellaneous - some previous works that I don't count on being able to run independently
